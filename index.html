      <p>I’ve had a Rasberry Pi for a while now and I’ve been neglecting it due to other concerns. But, recently I’ve had time to sit down and start preparing it for usage. Of course, the first thing thing that should be done with it is installing Docker.

        What is Docker? Well, according to the website it is:
        Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Today’s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.

        So, translating into the language of a normal person Docker is a software which is a contained box of the software you configure and can launch on the Docker service where ever you happen to be running Docker. This allows you to only worry about what your own software will do as opposed to worrying about other details. Granted, some level of extra configuration will be required to getting containers to talk to one another for more advanced configurations.

        But, that’s limited by your ability to improvise. Luckily, there is an image for the ARM architecture already built for us; we’re just going to worry about getting it working today.

        I’ve already ssh’d to the Rasberry Pi and now we just need to try and install it:


        [root@alarmpi alarm]# pacman -Su docker
        :: Starting full system upgrade...

        error: failed to commit transaction (unexpected error)
        Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded.

        Pacman is the package manager for Arch linux – which is what I’ll be running on the device.
        The S flag means syncronize which is equivalent to install in Debian or Ubuntu. The u will limit the packages checked to those that are out of date; it’s not that important for this example.
        You’ll also notice that this didn’t work – I got 404 errors – and this is due to the servers being out of date. That one took me a bit of searching to find out.
