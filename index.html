    <h1>Title of the Post</h1>
    <p> Here is some text:
    Nothing motivates one to write code more than necessity and need. But, nothing is more painful than looking over old code and marveling at your own incompetence. Today, we’ll be going over and laying bare a bit of my own growth as a coder. See, at work we – like most support environments – use ticketing systems to manage and communicate with customers. But, we also have automated systems that report issues immediately as they happen. These “Automated Reporting Tickets” can generate what are, in spirit, duplicate issue tickets for the same client. Having multiple techs monitor the same issue on different computers for a single client wastes valuable time. And, since technicians time is linear and limited to one issue at a time, we want the distribution of work to be as efficient as possible.
